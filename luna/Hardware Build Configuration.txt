Code and Go is a single source code application. Applications for multiple device types are build from the same source code.

To build the application for MP200 (Wi-Fi configuration), change the HardwareDef.h file to:

#ifndef HARDWAREDEF_H
#define	HARDWAREDEF_H
#define POS_DEVICE      "MP200"
#define UP_ARROW        'U'
#define DOWN_ARROW      'D'
#endif

To build the application for VEGA3000 (Wi-Fi configuration), change the HardwareDef.h file to:

#ifndef HARDWAREDEF_H
#define	HARDWAREDEF_H
#define POS_DEVICE      "VEGA3000"
#define UP_ARROW        'P'
#define DOWN_ARROW      'Q'
#endif
